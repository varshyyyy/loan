      answer: 'Yes, EasyLoan charges a processing fee ranging from 0.5% to 2% of the loan amount, depending on the loan type. The fee is deducted from the disbursed amount. We occasionally run promotions with reduced or waived processing fees.',
      category: 'Fees'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I miss a loan repayment?',
      answer: 'Missing a repayment results in a late payment fee (typically 2% of the EMI amount) and may impact your credit score. If you anticipate difficulty making a payment, contact us before the due date to discuss possible solutions like payment rescheduling.',
